# RosProyect
## This is a schoolar proyect to control a mobile robot using ROS through an interface by serial communication with an xbox controller
Important notes


The python version used in the proyect is python 2.7
For the raspberry pi:
We are using ubiquity robotics operating system instead of rasbian due to it already has ROS installed
## Every time that the raspberry pi boots for the very fist time do the following:

You must enable the following **repositories**:
```
UNIVERSE: sudo add-apt-repository universe
MULTIVERSE:sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
RESTRICTED: sudo add-apt-repository restricted
```
Configure the locals:
```
export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```
A window will appear, just ignore everything and lick "ok"

To install openCV for python in the raspberry pi follow the steps from:
> https://github.com/tizianofiorenzani/how_do_drones_work/blob/master/opencv/OPENCV_INSTALL.txt

Run video.py example
To stream the video through ssh run the following command:
```
ssh -X user@ip_user 
```
 then run the opencv video example, and you should be able to see the video
 
## Tkinter

If you don't have python then install it
> sudo apt-get install python

To make or run a interface on Tkinter its neccesary to have it installed
```
sudo apt-get install python-tk
sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk
```
### How to use it

Open the promp of python using *promp*
Now import Tkinter module
```
>>>import Tkinter
>>>
```
To check if Tkinter was properly installed run
```
>>>Tkinter()
```

## In case you want to use joy_node with an xbox control(in our case)
You need to install the joy_node. You can copy and paste into your terminal:
> http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick

Be careful at the moment you type the distribution, e.g. kinetic, melodic, indigo, etc
```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-joy
```
